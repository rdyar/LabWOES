      Welcome to LabWOES, a name created by combining LabWorks (our POS) and
      ROES (our old ordering system). It just happens to have a nice sound to
      it, and sometimes aptly describes the current situation at the shop.

      This site is a place where I keep track of some of the things that go on
      in my <a href="https://prolabprints.com">Photo Lab</a> business, mostly
      relating to our ordering systems, POS system and various other things
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't expect to update this site a whole lot, though it does pull in my
      GitHub Issues where I post problems that I have with different things in
      the lab. Mostly this is for my own purposes, as it is an easy way to keep
      track of things but I also like that it is public so maybe it can save
      someone else from some of the headaches I have had. You are welcome to
      post in the issues yourself and I would be happy to try and help if I can,
      or maybe someone else can.

      There is also a very handy
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/calculator/"
        >photographic paper and chemistry cost calculator</a
      >
      that you may find useful. I may also post a video or blog post once in a
      while, as well as some links to things I like.
